# Kajian-s-Portfolio

Website made by Kajian Pulenthirasingam.

My first portfolio made for me from me. I took the challenge to create my own portfolio that is responsive. I made it so that when you click on my first project, it directs you to the website that I was fixing for semantic issues. I learned how to use flex-box styling and css selectors to make my very own profile.
For installing my project you just need to clone this code to your repository. This website has links you can click on to other sections of the page. It also has a picture of me.
